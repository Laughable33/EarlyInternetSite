        <h1>Reject H.J. Res. 86: Protecting Internet Privacy and the Future of the Digital Economy</h1>
        <p>April 28, 2023</p>

        <p>In an era where privacy and security are of paramount concern, it's crucial to be aware of the legislative actions that impact our rights online. One such action is the proposed House Joint Resolution 86 (H.J. Res. 86). This resolution aims to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) privacy rules for internet service providers (ISPs), which were adopted in 2016. These rules safeguard the online privacy of users and require ISPs to obtain explicit consent before sharing or selling sensitive customer data. In this blog post, we will discuss why it is essential to reject H.J. Res. 86 and protect our internet privacy.</p>
        
        <p>Upholding Consumer Privacy Rights - The FCC's rules are designed to protect consumers' sensitive information, such as browsing history, financial data, and precise geolocation data. By dismantling these rules, H.J. Res. 86 would allow ISPs to collect and share this information without obtaining consent from users. This is a blatant violation of privacy rights, and it's vital that we stand against such intrusion.</p>

        <p>The Importance of Informed Content - The FCC rules require ISPs to obtain "opt-in" consent from their customers before sharing sensitive data. This ensures that users have the right to decide whether or not they want their information shared or sold. H.J. Res. 86 would effectively remove this requirement, making it significantly more challenging for users to control their own data. By rejecting H.J. Res. 86, we can continue to prioritize informed consent and protect users' ability to make their own choices about their data.</p>

        <p>Maintaining a Competitive Online Marketplace - ISPs hold a unique position in the digital economy because they control the flow of information between users and the internet. This gives them unparalleled access to customer data, which can be sold to the highest bidder. Without the FCC's privacy rules in place, ISPs would have free rein to exploit this data for their own gain, potentially creating an unfair advantage over other online businesses. By rejecting H.J. Res. 86, we can maintain a level playing field for all players in the digital economy.</p>

        <p>Preventing Discrimination and Manipulation - ISPs can potentially use consumer data to discriminate against certain users or manipulate the information they receive. For example, they might charge higher prices to users who visit specific websites or block access to competitors' sites. The FCC's privacy rules help prevent this kind of behavior by limiting the information ISPs can access and share without consent. Rejecting H.J. Res. 86 is crucial to preventing discrimination and manipulation in the online space.</p>

        <p>Encouraging Innovation and Trust - Privacy is a fundamental pillar of trust in the digital age. By protecting users' sensitive information, the FCC's rules encourage innovation and growth in the online ecosystem. If H.J. Res. 86 were to pass, the erosion of trust between consumers and ISPs could lead to a decline in online activity and stifle innovation. By rejecting H.J. Res. 86, we can continue to foster a thriving digital economy built on a foundation of trust and privacy.</p>

        <p>In summary, rejecting H.J. Res. 86 is crucial for upholding consumer privacy rights, maintaining informed consent, ensuring a competitive online marketplace, preventing discrimination and manipulation, and encouraging innovation and trust in the digital economy. The FCC's privacy rules were designed to protect users and foster a fair and secure online environment. It is our responsibility to safeguard these protections by rejecting any attempt to dismantle them, such as H.J. Res. 86. Together, we can ensure a more secure and private internet experience for all.</p>
